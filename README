# NS73M FM transmitter - Arduino library																										 
## by SkyWodd

This program is an Arduino library for the NS73M low power FM transmitter.
NS73M is a low power FM transmitter controlable by I2C or SPI bus (only software SPI is used in this library).
It can be used like any chinese FM car transmitter but with full control of transmission specifications.
This include power managemnt, input volume level, emphasis, target frequency, and much other.

Note: Based on software SPI function and frequency formula from Cai Maver
